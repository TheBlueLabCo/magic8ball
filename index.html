   <h1>Magic 8 Ball</h1>

<p>I never owned a Magic 8 Ball - so I decided to code my own!</p>
<p>This ball works very similar, so I'm told. You ask a yes/no question (you can even pose it out loud, this Magic 8 Ball has telepathic properties) and with the click of a button the Almighty gives you an answer.</p>

<p>Disclaimer: Neither I nor anybody else who has cooperated in building or executing this program is responsible for any actions you do or not take based on this answer. By using this program, you agree with this.</p>
